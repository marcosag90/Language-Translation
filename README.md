 # Language-Translation with seq2seq RNN
 In this project, we make use of word2vec and sec2sec to generate a language translator replicating the latest Google Translate technology.
 
 To run the project, you will need:
 -Python 2.4
 -Numpy
 -Tensorflow 1.3.0
 
 There is a Tensorflow error in Anaconda in cell 7, but it has no effect on the program. All the tests are passed, and the network is trained and runs normally.
